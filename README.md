# CyberVisuals
This Python program visualizes and simulates a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Tkinter. It demonstrates how an attacker can intercept and manipulate messages between two parties (Alice and Bob). The simulation helps educate users on how MITM attacks work in a controlled, visual environment.
